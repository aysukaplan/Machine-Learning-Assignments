# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains solutions to fundamental machine learning class assignments.

## Assignment 0: Introduction 

### Overview
The goal of this assignment is to introduce the Scikit-Learn library for classification methods and metrics. Work with k-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms using Stellar Classification Dataset .

## Assignment 1: K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

### Overview
The objective of this assignment is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. It comprises two parts: a KNN-classification experiment and a KNN-regression experiment.

#### Part 1: Classification of News Articles
Implement a nearest neighbor algorithm to categorize news articles into five categories: Sport, Business, Politics, Entertainment, Tech. Extend the implementation as a weighted KNN algorithm.

#### Part 2: Medical Insurance Cost Estimation
Implement a nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate medical insurance costs for individuals. Extend the implementation as a weighted KNN algorithm.

## Assignment 2: Decision Tree Algorithm

### Overview
This assignment focuses on gaining insights into the decision tree algorithm. Experiment with the decision tree model using the ID3 algorithm on the Flower Species dataset.

#### Part 1: Flower Species Classification
Implement a decision tree model to classify flower species using the ID3 algorithm on a provided dataset.

#### Part 2: Pruning Decision Tree
Mitigate overfitting in the decision tree by pruning the twigs. Use the provided train, test, and validation split for the pruning process.

## Assignment 3: Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Overview
This assignment aims to deepen understanding of Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) concepts.

#### Flower Classification of Images using Neural Network and CNN
Implement a Neural Network and CNN to classify images in the Flower Species Dataset.

#### Part 1: Multi-Layer Neural Network
Implement a multi-layer neural network for classification, consisting of one input layer, n hidden layer(s), and one output layer. Implement forward and backward propagations with the loss function and learning settings.

#### Part 2: Convolutional Neural Network
Utilize a pretrained VGG-19 CNN and finetune it to classify sample images.
